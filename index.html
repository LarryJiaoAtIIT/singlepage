			<p class="introText">
			Source Film maker is a video-capturing and editing application that works inside 
			the Source Game Engine. The tool, created by ValVe Corporation, has been used
			to create over 50 animated shorts for its Source games, including <i>Team Fortress 2</i>,
			the <i>Left 4 Dead</i> series, and <i>Half-Life</i> series.

			<p class="ClipText">
			The Clip Editor is used in the final production of your animation. You will be able to see your
			creation come to life after adding the lights, camera, and the action. Everything piece of effort
			you have placed will come into full effect with the clip editor, as you place audio clips within the
			same codecs in here.

		as change facial structure of the individual playermodels within a keyframe.
