			the Source Game Engine. The tool, created by ValVe Corporation, has been used

			<p class="ClipText">
			The Clip Editor is used in the final production of your animation. You will be able to see your
			creation come to life after adding the lights, camera, and the action. Everything piece of effort
			you have placed will come into full effect with the clip editor, as you place audio clips within the
			same codecs in here.

		very granular changes for the inbetweens, adjust the amount of velocity a movement is positioned, as well
		as change facial structure of the individual playermodels within a keyframe.
